# rcsbechtop UCSF
Here we explain an overview of different RC+S benchtop elements and uses developed at the UCSF Starr Lab

## Overview
The goal of the UCSF RC+S benchtop is to create a physical environment to gain experience using the different functionalities of the RC+S device. A first version of a benchtop setup suitable for RC+S was developed by our colleague Maria Olaru [UCSF-benchtop system] (https://github.com/openmind-consortium/UCSF_benchtop_testing). Here we extend that original version of the setup to be able to interface other signal generation devices. We also add some further work on the Star tissue load, adding more use cases.
